## Macchiato Lungo

Set of classes representing instructions of a programming language Macchiato. Syntax of Macchiato includes for loop, if statements, variables, math expressions, print command, command blocks, void functions recieving arguments, local variable scopes.

Macchiato also provides a set of simple debugging commands avilable in the debug mode. Those commands being:  
* c - continue program till it's ending.  
* s <integer> - execute given amount of program steps.  
* d <integer> - display all the variables and functions visible in the scope that are above the current scope by given amount of levels.  
* m - dump results of the debugger command 'd 0' into a given file.  
* e - stop the program execution and exits the debugger.

In order to make creating Macchiato programs in Java easier, the code is eqquiped with a set of builder classes. The code also includes JUnit tests for each syntax construction of Macchiato.
